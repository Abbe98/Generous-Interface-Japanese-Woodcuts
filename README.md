# Generous Interface Fashion
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/riksantikvarieambetet/Generous-Interface-Fashion)

This project was created within the scope of the Swedish National Heritage Boardâ€™s evaluation of generous interfaces as a complement to common web interfaces of archives and museums often dominated by text search. This prototype is centered around images, fashion and the history of dress and costume. The intended user of the prototype is a person with deep interest in the topic and who is an activ hobbyist producing her own designs or clothes. She could be a cosplayer, a LARPer or simply someone who likes to make vintage or historical clothing.
